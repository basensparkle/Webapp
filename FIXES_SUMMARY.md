# ICT Eerbeek - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 🎉 What I Fixed

Your friend's application had several critical issues that prevented it from being self-hosted. I've completely fixed all of them.

### ❌ Problems Found

1. **OAuth Dependency**: The app required Manus OAuth to create and manage users
2. **No User Creation**: There was no way to create users without Manus account
3. **Page Creation Issues**: While the API existed, it wasn't properly accessible
4. **Deployment Script**: Lacked error handling, debugging, and automation
5. **Database Configuration**: No clear path to use your own database

### ✅ Solutions Implemented

## 1. Local Authentication System (NEW)

I created a complete local authentication system that replaces the Manus OAuth dependency:

- **Email/Password Login**: Users can now login with email and password
- **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with salt
- **User Registration**: New users can be created via admin panel or CLI
- **No External Dependencies**: Everything runs on your server

**New Files**:
- `server/_core/localAuth.ts` - Complete authentication implementation
- `server/init-admin.ts` - CLI tool to create admin users

**New API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new users
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/init-admin` - Create first admin user

## 2. User Management

**Fixed**: User creation now works completely!

- ✅ Create admin user via command line: `pnpm init-admin`
- ✅ Create additional users via admin panel
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, content_editor, user)
- ✅ Email-based user lookup
- ✅ Password management

**Database Changes**:
- Added `passwordHash` field to store encrypted passwords
- Added `passwordSalt` field for password security
- Added `getUserByEmail()` function
- Added `createLocalUser()` function

## 3. Page Creation

**Fixed**: Page creation is now fully functional!

The page creation API was already in the code, but I:
- ✅ Verified all endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Ensured proper role-based access control
- ✅ Tested create, read, update, delete operations
- ✅ Confirmed bilingual content support (NL/EN)

## 4. Improved Deployment Script

**New File**: `deploy-plesk-improved.sh`

This is a complete rewrite with professional features:

### Features Added:
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Everything logged to `deployment-logs/deploy-TIMESTAMP.log`
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for network operations
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Can run non-interactively
- ✅ **Progress Reporting**: Clear status updates at each step
- ✅ **System Checks**: Validates prerequisites before starting
- ✅ **Database Testing**: Verifies database connection before proceeding
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Tests application after deployment
- ✅ **Backup**: Automatically backs up existing .env files
- ✅ **Credentials File**: Saves all credentials securely

### One-Click Installation:
```bash
# Just run this after extracting:
bash deploy-plesk-improved.sh
```

The script will:
1. Install Node.js, pnpm, PM2
2. Configure MySQL database
3. Generate security keys
4. Install dependencies
5. Run database migrations
6. Seed initial data
7. Build the application
8. Configure PM2 and Nginx
9. Start the application
10. Verify everything works
